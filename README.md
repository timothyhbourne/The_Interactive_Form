# The_Interactive_Form
 This project is an interactive web form that is interactive and also validates user input in real time. To create this form, I needed to showcase my ability in several topics of Javascript. The skills required and used to create this interactive web form was DOM Scripting, DOM Manipulation, Data Validation, RegEx, and Event Handlers to name a few. 
# Extra Details
 - Name Input Check
 In the name section, I've added multiple error messages depending on the user input. If the user types in a number, an error message will appear saying "Name field cannot contain a number". If the user leaves the name field blank, an error message will say "Name field cannot be empty"
 - Accessibility 
 To ensure that the site is as accessible as it can be, user can "Tab" through each field within the form. 
 - Payment Flexibility
 The form will still submit and react the same if the user chooses to pay using any of the payment methods. 
 - Real Time Validation
 The form will validate the user input during real time. This real time validation is applied into the Name, Email, Activities, and Payment input.
