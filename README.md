# The_Interactive_Form
 This project is an interactive web form that is interactive and also validates user input in real time. To create this form, I needed to showcase my ability in several topics of Javascript. The skills required and used to create this interactive web form was DOM Scripting, DOM Manipulation, Data Validation, RegEx, and Event Handlers to name a few.
